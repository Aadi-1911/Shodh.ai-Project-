                    LOAN APPROVAL POLICY ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This report compares two approaches for loan approval decisions:
- Deep Learning (DL): MLP classifier predicting default probability
- Offline RL: Conservative Q-Learning policy optimizing financial returns

2. MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
----------------------------
[See model_comparison.png for visualizations]

3. KEY FINDINGS
---------------
• Both models outperform the historical "approve all" policy
• RL policy is more conservative, leading to lower default rates
• DL model provides calibrated risk scores for interpretability
• The models agree on most decisions but diverge on borderline cases

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------
• Short-term: Combine both models for robust decision-making
• Medium-term: Implement online learning with careful exploration
• Long-term: Build comprehensive risk management framework

5. NEXT STEPS
-------------
1. Deploy DL model for risk scoring in production
2. A/B test RL policy on a subset of borderline decisions
3. Collect feedback data for model improvement
4. Develop explainability dashboards for loan officers
